Chorgi

Chorgi is a non-AI MIDI generator developed to emulate generic playing styles, providing users with a straightforward and creative music composition tool.

About the Project
This project is developed independently and without the extensive financial resources available to larger companies producing similar software. Despite these constraints, Chorgi aims to deliver an innovative and functional solution for MIDI generation. A detailed roadmap will be shared once the foundational build is complete.

Current Limitations
Platform: Currently available only for Windows.
Integration: Runs as a standalone application and is not yet compatible with DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations). Since Chorgi is fully coded in Python, wrapping it into a VST format presents unique challenges, which are being actively explored for future updates.
