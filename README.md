# Chorgi
Non AI midi generator which has been trained off of generic playing styles. 

Please note that I am one person working on this project, I do not have the thousands of dollars that other companies making similar software have. I will create a roadmap once we have finished building the core parts and the UI of the software. 

Currently it is limited to windows and cannot be used inside of a DAW, it runs outside of the DAW as it is 100% coded using Python and wrapping that into VST is going to be a pai, this is something that is most likely going to be a feature in 2.0.
